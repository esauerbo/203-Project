--Entity--
getAnimationPeriod() : this was moved to Entity because the only parameter in the function is an Entity object
nextImage() : this was moved to Entity because the only parameter in the function is an Entity object


--WorldModel--
getBackgroundCell(), setBackgroundCell(), setBackground(), withinBounds(), getBackgroundImage() : these functions were all
moved to WorldModel because WorldModel is the class in charge of keeping track of background elements. These functions only
relied on the WorldModel and Background classes.


--Action--
--WorldView--
drawViewPort() : moved to WorldView becuase only class variable it depends on is WorldView
drawEntities() : moved to WorldView becuase this function only relies on attributes in the WorldView class
drawBackground() : moved to WorldView because it relies on WorldView, Viewport, and WorldModel. WorldView contains
                   these attribute and additionally is meant to control drawing.
shiftView() : this was moved to WorldView because it relies on WorldView, Viewport, and WorldModel. It would make sense to
              put this function in Viewport because Viewport controls what part of the world we see, however WorldModel cannot
              be accessed through Viewport.




--Viewport--
viewportToWorld() : this was moved to Viewport because the only class variable it depended on was Viewport
worldToViewport() : this was moved to Viewport because the only class variable it depended on was Viewport
clamp() : this was moved to Viewport because it is called on the Viewport object
shift() : this was moved to Viewport because it is called on the Viewport object
contains() : this was moved to Viewport because it is called on a Viewport object. It also uses a point object, but the point
             isn't included in any other classes, so it will remain as a parameter.

--VirtualWorld--



--Functions--
executeAction(), executeAnimationAction(), executeActivityAction(),


--Point--
adjacent() : this function compares two points so was moved to the points class
